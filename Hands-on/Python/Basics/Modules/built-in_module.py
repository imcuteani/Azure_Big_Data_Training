# Python has support for importing file/function using key word called import. 
# the built-in modules can be imported in the code like os, sys, random, statistics, collections, json etc. 


# OS module 

# using os module, we can perform many different os level tasks. The OS module in python provides functions
# for creating, changing current working directory, removing a directory/folder, fetching its contents etc. 


import os 
os.mkdir('<your_working_directory>')
os.getcwd()           # getting current working directory
os.rmdir('<your_working_directory>')
